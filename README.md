Sentiment Detector

Overview:
This is a machine learning program that predicts the emotional sentiment 
(postivie,neutral,negative) and intensity score of text. It uses either
a Naive Bayes or SVM algorithm to train the program. Instenisty is found using 
a Linear Regression algorithm.

Before Running:
Make sure you have all the necessary python packages installed
such as numpy, pandas, seaborn, etc.

When you run the file for the first time, write:
- nltk.download('punkt') 
- nltk.download('stopwords')
- nltk.download('wordnet')

Dataset:
The current version of the program expects a CSV file to have three columns,
Sentiment,Text/Description,Score. Due to this the previous CSV files are
incompatible with the Detector. 

Run file and Choose From Menu:

    What to Run:
    1- To see our model's quality: Will show how well the model performs (accuracy, confusion model, etc.)
    2- Test your own text: Input text to get the predicted sentiment and score.
    3- Comapare to a prebuilt model: Compares the machine learning's accuracy to that of a VADER model.

    Choose the model:
    1- Naive Bayes (Faster, recommended)
    2- SVM (Slower, more accurate)

Note: Previous training/testing sets were left to show the difference in traning data.
You can customize the dataset if you want.
